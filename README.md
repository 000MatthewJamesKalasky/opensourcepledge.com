## Onboarding

To help us build [OSS Pledge](https://osspledge.com/), please [dive into our
issues](https://github.com/osspledge/osspledge.com/issues) or reach out to the
working group leads listed above either in issues or [on
Discord](https://discord.gg/v8vuSwky).

### Members

The Pledge is [under active
development](https://github.com/osspledge/osspledge.com/issues/4). We aim to
publish a website by September 1, with instructions on how your company can
publish your Pledge report with us. In the mean time, **pay Open Source
maintainers**. The minimum to participate in the Pledge is $2,000 per year per
full-time developer on staff.

### Maintainers

OSS Pledge is not involved in any flow of funds and so we do not directly
onboard maintainers. We encourage you to onboard to the following platforms to
receive funding from OSS Pledge Members (‚≠êÔ∏è = recommended):
