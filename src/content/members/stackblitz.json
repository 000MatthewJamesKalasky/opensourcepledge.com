We also have a close relationship with Open Source teams. They are avid users of our tools and help us improve them in a close feedback loop. We have been involved in key projects, hiring maintainers of infrastructure projects like Vite and Vitest and organizing ViteConf, a free online event for the Web community. We're happy to continue giving back to the Open Source community by joining the Open Source Pledge.",
